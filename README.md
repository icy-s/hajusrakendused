# Hajusrakendused – Distributed Systems Project

This project was developed as part of the **Hajusrakendused (Distributed Systems)** course.  
It demonstrates practical skills in building a simple distributed web application using a RESTful architecture, separating server and client logic, and enabling structured communication between them.

## 🚀 Features

- REST API built with **Node.js / Express**
- Client-side integration using **Fetch API**
- JSON-based request/response handling
- Routing and middleware structure
- Asynchronous client–server communication
- Basic principles of distributed systems
- Clear separation between services and layers

## 🧩 What this project demonstrates

- Designing and implementing REST endpoints  
- Connecting front-end and back-end components  
- Handling multi-step data flows between services  
- Structuring applications using controllers and middleware  
- Understanding the fundamentals of distributed architectures  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **Fetch API**
- **JSON**
- **HTML / CSS (if applicable)**
